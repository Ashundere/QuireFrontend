# Quire, A Task Management App

This app will help you manage tasks

### Description

Using the MERN stack, this app handles authentication and authorization using a secure register and log-in procedure. Once logged-in, users can manage projects and tasks, with the ability to create, update, edit, and delete both tasks and projects. There is a dashboard that displays the currently active task, as well as provides user features such as the current date and time, and a pomodoro timer for better focus states. Additionally, there is a project manager page, which displays all projects created by the user. And a task manager page, which displays all tasks created by the user. The project manager page displays individual projects as clickable cards, which will take you to the individual project page. This is where you can view relevant tasks as well as update and delete the project. You can also click the tasks to go to the individual task page where you are able to do the same. Also featured on the individual project page is the ability to change your currently active project (the one displayed on the dashboard) as well as the ability to create new tasks.
